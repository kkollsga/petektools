# petekTools guide

**Scattered-data gridding & geostatistics kernels for Rust** — the numerics
layer the ecosystem was missing, plus a small curated front-door over mature
numeric crates and a domain-agnostic bundle viewer.

## What it is (the gap it fills)

Rust already has excellent crates for linear algebra (`faer`), statistics and
distributions (`statrs`, `rand_distr`), FFT (`rustfft`), and spatial indexing
(`kiddo`, `rstar`). What it has lacked is a production-grade way to turn
**scattered `(x, y, z)` observations into a regular grid** — minimum-curvature
surfaces, inverse-distance weighting, nearest-neighbour fills. petekTools fills
exactly that gap, and curates the rest behind one small door.

If you have points and need a surface — a depth grid from well picks, a property
map from samples, any scattered field on a regular lattice — this is the crate.
It is a **pure leaf**: it depends only on general-purpose numeric crates, never on
a domain model, and stays usable standalone (and, via a thin PyO3 wheel, from
Python).

Design principles that shape the whole surface:

- **One job.** Scattered-data gridding / geostatistics — the gap. Everything else
  (linear algebra, stats, neighbour search) is *curated* from mature crates,
  never reimplemented.
- **Type-agnostic kernels.** A kernel speaks a plain [`Lattice`] + `[[f64; 3]]`
  rows and returns `ndarray::Array2<f64>` — never a caller's domain type. Adoption
  is a conversion at the call site, not a rewrite.
- **Numerical honesty.** Deterministic, documented to a stated tolerance, with
  analytic cases asserted as tests (a linear trend is the exact minimum-curvature
  solution; IDW is exact at coincident samples). No silent clamping, no magic
  defaults — locked constants (e.g. IDW `p = 2`) are named and cited.

## Gridding methods

The `grid(points, lattice, method)` dispatcher takes `[x, y, z]` rows and a
target lattice and returns an `ncol × nrow` `Array2<f64>` (undefined nodes are
`NaN`). Pick the method with the `GridMethod` enum:

| `GridMethod`        | What it does                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Nearest`           | Each node takes its areally-closest sample's `z` (blocky, exact at data). |
| `InverseDistance`   | Global IDW with `p = 2`; exact at coincident samples.                    |
| `MinimumCurvature`  | Briggs biharmonic SOR — smooth, honours the samples.                     |

```rust
use petektools::{grid, GridMethod, Lattice};

// A 100×80 grid, 25 m spacing, origin at (1000, 2000).
let lattice = Lattice::regular(1000.0, 2000.0, 25.0, 25.0, 100, 80);
let points  = [[1010.0, 2008.0, 12.5], [1240.0, 2300.0, 18.1], [1880.0, 3100.0, 9.4]];
let surface = grid(&points, &lattice, GridMethod::MinimumCurvature).unwrap();
```

## Warm-start & `ConvergentGridder`

Editing a surface point-by-point? Re-solving minimum curvature from scratch on
every nudge is wasteful. Seed the solver from the prior field and it converges in
a fraction of the iterations to the **same** field — measured **~4–7× faster** on
a typical structural edit, rising to **~250×** in the near-converged incremental
limit. A `None` or wrong-shape seed simply falls back to a cold solve.

```rust
use petektools::{grid, grid_min_curvature_seeded, GridMethod, Lattice};

let lattice = Lattice::regular(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 64, 64);
let points  = [[1.0, 1.0, 10.0], [60.0, 60.0, 40.0]];
let cold = grid(&points, &lattice, GridMethod::MinimumCurvature).unwrap();
// After nudging the data: relax from the prior field instead of cold-starting.
let warm = grid_min_curvature_seeded(&points, &lattice, Some(&cold)).unwrap();
```

For interactive, one-control-at-a-time refinement the stateful `ConvergentGridder`
keeps the field between edits so each new control is cheap:

```rust
use petektools::{ConvergentGridder, Lattice};

let lattice = Lattice::regular(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 64, 64);
let points  = [[1.0, 1.0, 10.0], [60.0, 60.0, 40.0]];
let mut gridder = ConvergentGridder::new(&points, &lattice).unwrap();
let field = gridder.add_control(32, 40, 25.0); // pin a node, re-solve incrementally
```

## Geometry: `Lattice`

A regular, **rotatable** areal lattice (the IRAP/RMS model): origin, spacing,
node counts, CCW rotation, and an optional y-flip. It carries the forward map
`node_xy(i, j)`, its inverse `xy_to_ij(x, y)`, and a `bbox()` — everything a
kernel needs to place a sample on the grid. Kernels never take a caller's grid
type; they take a `Lattice`, so any regular areal grid maps on field-for-field.

## 1-D interpolation

`interp1d` is the shared resampling kernel for curve-like data such as well
logs. The Rust surface accepts finite, strictly increasing `x` knots, matching
`y` values, query positions, an `Interp1dMethod`, and an `extrapolate` flag. The
Python wheel exposes the same kernel as:

```python
import petektools as pt

values = pt.interp1d(
    [1000.0, 1001.0, 1003.0],
    [0.22, 0.25, 0.21],
    [1000.5, 1002.0],
    method="cubic",
)
```

Methods are `nearest`/`closest`, `previous`/`ffill`, `next`/`bfill`, `linear`,
and `cubic`/`spline`. The cubic method is a natural cubic spline (`S'' = 0` at
both endpoints), implemented in Rust as a clean-room numeric kernel. It is not
SciPy's default not-a-knot spline.

## Geostatistics

Beyond deterministic gridding, petekTools ships a geostatistics front-door: an
omnidirectional **experimental variogram**, a fitted **`Variogram`** model
(`Nugget` / `Spherical` / `Exponential` / `Gaussian`), moving-neighbourhood
**ordinary kriging** (estimate + variance), and **sequential Gaussian
simulation** for conditioned stochastic realizations. Kriging and SGS both solve
small dense neighbourhoods (up to `max_neighbours` samples within a `radius`) and
run with the GIL released from Python. See the `01_geostat_tour` notebook for the
full experimental-variogram → fit → krige → simulate walk-through.

## The curated front-doors: units, stats, sampling

These modules are deliberately *thin* — they curate a mature crate behind a small,
named surface rather than reinvent it.

- **`units`** — a domain-agnostic SI/metric reporting layer: `km2 ↔ m2`,
  `m3 ↔ mcm / msm3 / bcm`, `scf ↔ Sm³`, `stb ↔ Sm³`, and `format_volume` for
  human-readable output. (`Sm³` is a scale label, not PVT.)
- **`stats`** — descriptive statistics with an Excel-parity `percentile`
  (type-7): `mean` / `variance` / `std` / `median` / `percentile`, plus the full
  weighted family (`weighted_mean`, `weighted_percentile`, …). Realization-set
  helpers `reservoir_summary` (the P90 = low exceedance digest, `p90 ≤ p50 ≤ p10`)
  and `aggregate` (per-segment sum under a correlation assumption) sit here too.
- **`sampling`** — validated distribution samplers (`uniform` / `normal` /
  `lognormal` / `triangular` / `truncated_normal`) drawn through a seeded `Rng`
  for bit-for-bit reproducibility, plus a `.clamped(lo, hi)` hard-limiter
  combinator. Same seed + params reproduces the identical stream every time.

## Synthetic generators

A family of **seeded, believable synthetic-data** generators — for tests,
demos, tutorials, and benchmarking without any real dataset. All are
bit-reproducible from their seed, and fractions live in `[0, 1]`.

- **Surfaces & maps** — `synth_dome_surface` (an elliptical four-way closure with
  tilt and correlated noise), `synth_isochore` (a thickness map), `synth_trend_map`
  (a `[0, 1]` depositional trend, optionally correlated with another field).
- **Wells & outlines** — `place_wells` / `place_wells_in_polygon` (seeded well
  heads), `closure_outline` (the largest closed contour of a surface at a spill
  level), `study_area_outline` (a rounded-rectangle extent), `tops_from_surface`
  (pick a top per well with a residual draw).
- **Trajectories** — `synth_trajectory` (vertical) and `synth_trajectory_profile`
  (`build_hold` / `build_hold_drop` directional wells by the minimum-curvature
  relation), with `max_dogleg_severity` as a believability yardstick.
- **Petrophysics** — `synth_facies_series` (binary sand/shale), `synth_log_series`
  (a zoned, depth-autocorrelated log over a `ZoneSpec` stack), and
  `synth_por_with_facies` (porosity coupled onto a facies series).
- **`Georef`** — a fictional world-frame origin that builds a world-placed
  `Lattice` and translates locally-built points into the same frame.

The `02_synthetic_data_tour` notebook builds a whole synthetic asset — structure,
outline, wells, trajectories, and coupled petrophysical curves — from these.

## The viewer unit (brief)

petekTools also ships the **viewer** — a packaged, domain-agnostic inspection
viewer (`petektools.viewer`, wheel-only; excluded from the crates.io Rust crate so
the kernel stays lean). Any library that maps its data onto the
[generic render schema](../python/petektools/viewer/SCHEMA.md) can drive it:
build a typed JSON payload of map raster layers, section columns, and/or a
corner-point mesh, then `serve()` it (a live local server) or `save_view()` it
(one self-contained HTML file, all JS + data inlined, zero external network
fetches). It is **strictly bundle-driven** — it renders exactly what the payload
declares and computes nothing itself; new cross-sections come from a consumer's
`section_provider` callback (live) or are pre-computed into the payload (file).
The viewer is horizontal capability: it serves every layer of the ecosystem, so
it lives here. The full guide is in `VIEWER.md`.

For lightweight map QC, `petektools.view2d([...])` accepts point-like objects,
geometry-like objects, and triangulated meshes. Point sets render as points
only. Geometry-like objects render grid lines, and when they expose an `edge`
polygon the grid-line overlay is clipped to that edge so inferred grids,
structured surfaces, and point clouds line up in the same view. Mesh-like
objects (`triangles()` over `xyz()`/`points()` vertices) render their unique
triangle edges as grid lines with the mesh `edge` rings as the outline; a mesh
that also offers `wireframe_edges()` index pairs draws exactly those instead —
quad-dominant, with interior cell diagonals removed.

Three opt-in kwargs add value rendering, each explicit. `color=` colours
**points** by their z value (and selects the colormap for whatever is
value-coloured) — it never triggers fills. `fill=` asks each item offering
`value_layer()` for a per-node value layer and paints it as a value-coloured
fill *under* the grid lines (each triangle flat-filled with the colormap
colour of its mean node value; a triangle touching a NaN node is left
unfilled). `contours=25.0` asks each item offering `iso_lines()` for contour
polylines at a 25-unit interval (`iso_lines(interval=25.0)`), while
`contours=[1500, 1550]` requests exact levels (`iso_lines(levels=...)`).

`color=` and `fill=` accept `True` or a string spec parsed by registry match:
`"[<attr>_]<cmap>[_<min>_<max>]"` with `<cmap>` one of `viridis` / `magma` /
`grays` / `inferno` — so `color="inferno"` picks the colormap,
`color="inferno_-2700_-2500"` adds an explicit clamp range (out-of-range
values clamp to the ramp ends), `color="porosity"` stays an attribute name
(forwarded as `attr=` to `iso_lines`; `fill="porosity"` asks
`value_layer(attr="porosity")`), and `"porosity_inferno_0_0.3"` combines all
three. A malformed spec (e.g. one trailing float) raises `ValueError`. The
viewer panel gets a fill selector (when several items contribute fills),
"Fill"/"Contours" toggles, and a per-layer legend — type icon + the item's
duck-typed `name` (e.g. `"Top Agat"`) + the colour ramp and clamped range on
value-coloured layers. Items without these methods are silently unaffected:

```python
petektools.view2d([surface, well_points], color="inferno_-2700_-2500",
                  fill=True, contours=25.0)
```
